The code was written very quickly and very ugly, please apologize.
But if you have the CANopen profile for the twizy you can use the code to access everything, power and recuperation for example.
Some ugly thing I remember is that swapping the hexadecimal bytes needs a workaround, if the hex value is larger than 4 characters.

There are also a lot of infos around in the twizy forums.

Responses from my side may be delayed (it took 2 years to put the code online...)

Most frequent request was to support the Twizy45, which is technically only one ident byte and different default config.
